#neural networks-for-OTFS
    
    Signal detection of OTFS systems based on neural networks
Some popular neural network structures are recorded here, including CNN, DNN, etc., and there are also new self-attention algorithms. Try to combine the neural network with the OTFS system to achieve better performance.
